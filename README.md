# Data Analysis on Steam Game Releases (2021–2025)

## Overview

This project explores release patterns, genre distribution, and pricing behaviour within a Steam games dataset.  
The analysis focuses on publishing activity and market structure rather than sales performance.

The workflow combines Excel (Power Query) for data preparation and Tableau for interactive visual analysis.

## Dashboard Components (Tableau)

The Tableau dashboard examines release behaviour and category patterns.

**Game Price vs Player Recommendations**

- Explores relationship between pricing and player engagement  
- Highlights dispersion rather than a strict linear trend  

**Game Release Distribution by Genre**

- Identifies dominant release categories  
- Reveals uneven genre representation  

**Genre Pricing Comparison (2021 vs 2025)**

- Compares pricing stability over time  
- Shows limited variation across most genres  

**Genre Market Composition**

- Visualises category concentration  
- Demonstrates long-tail distribution behaviour

## Key Observations

- Release volumes vary significantly by genre  
- Certain genres dominate publishing activity  
- Pricing behaviour remains relatively stable  
- Player recommendations show high variability  
- No single pricing pattern explains engagement levels

## Final Conclusion

The dataset reveals that genre distribution, pricing behaviour, and player engagement interact in complex ways.  
While some genres dominate release volume, pricing patterns remain relatively consistent, and player recommendations vary widely.

Together, these visuals provide a broader view of market structure rather than indicating any single dominant trend.
